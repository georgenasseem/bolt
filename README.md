# Bolt

#### Bolt is a twitter clone. The project is built using HTML and CSS. The website is only a design, still none of the parts work. Although, I could say that it looks pretty similar to twitter. In bolt a tweet is called a bolt, just to make it a bit different. Information running Bolt , and contribution are listed down below.
